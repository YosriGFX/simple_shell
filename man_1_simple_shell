.SH NAME
simple_shell \- simple command interpreter "SASH"
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include "shell.h"
simple_shell [USERNAME]
.SH DESCRIPTION
simple_shell :
Is a command interpretor. It's a program that executes other programs.
It provides a computer user an interface so that the user can run different
commands or utilities/tools with some input data.
.SH OVERVIEW
When the simple_shell has finished executing a program, it sends an output
to the user on the screen, which is the standard output device.
For this reason, it is referred to as the “command interpretor”.
.SS Invocation
The shell will reads commands from a user input. When the shell is in interactive mode,
it displays a prompt and runs a process after the user types new command.
After the process terminates, the prompt will display again on the next line and the user can begin another process.
When the shell is running a script it's said to be in non-interactive mode.
That said, the user can emulate interactive mode by running a script that takes input from a user.
Simple_shell "sash" runs in both interactive and non-interactive modes.
.SS Example N°1

.SS Example N°3

.br
.SS Commands
Essentially though, a line is read and the first word  of the line is processed.
The input will either be processed as an executable, a built-in function, or an error message will be sent to stdout.
.br
.SS Path Search
When locating a command, the simple_shell first looks to see if it has a built-in function by that name.
It does this by searching for a builtin command by that name. If no built-in is found,
simple_shell searches through each directory provided in the users PATH variable. If no executable is found,
an error message is printed and the user is prompted to enter another command.
.br
.SS Builtins
This section lists the builtin commands which are builtin because they need to perform some operation that can't be performed by a separate process.

exit
